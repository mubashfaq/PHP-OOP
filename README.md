What is PHP OOP? — A detailed, practical guide

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP is a way of organizing code around objects — instances of classes that bundle data (properties) and behavior (methods). OOP helps structure large applications, improves code reusability, makes maintenance easier, and enables design patterns and architectures (like MVC) common in modern PHP frameworks.

Below I’ll explain the main concepts, language features, common patterns, and practical examples you can use right away.

1) Core concepts

Class — a blueprint that defines properties and methods.
Object — an instance of a class.
Property — a variable tied to a class/object.
Method — a function defined inside a class.
Encapsulation — hiding internal data and exposing a public API (via visibility).
Inheritance — a class can extend another class and reuse/override behavior.
Polymorphism — objects of different classes can be used through a common interface/parent type.
Abstraction — defining abstract classes/methods to force sub-classes to implement behavior.
